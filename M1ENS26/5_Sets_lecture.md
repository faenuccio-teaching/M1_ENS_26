# Sets

## Introduction
Sets are **primitive** objects when doing classical, pen-and-paper mathematics:
* no *definition*;
* only *rules* about how these objects work (unions, intersections, etc.).

That's all you need: do you ever look at $f\colon S \to T$ as $f\subseteq S\times T$?

We've seen that, for Lean, the **primitive objects** are types; yet
* sometimes we still want to speak about *sets* as collections of elements
* we want then to play the usual games.


## Definitions

+++ Every set lives in a **given** type, it is a set of elements (*terms*) in it:

    variable (α : Type) (S : Set α)

expresses that `α` is a type and `S` is a set of elements/terms of the type `α`. On the other hand,
```lean
variable (S : Set)
```
does not mean "let `S` be a set": it means nothing and it is an error.

+++

+++ A set coincides with the test-function defining it.

 Given a type `α`, a set `S` (of elements/terms of `α`) is a *function*
```lean
S : α → Prop
```
so `(Set α) = (α → Prop)`.

* This function is the "characteristic function" of the set `S`;
* the `a ∈ S` symbol means that the value of `S` is `True` when evaluated  at the element `a`;
* So, the positive integers are a *function*!

Yet, given a function `P : α → Prop` we prefer to write `setOf P : Set α` to denote the set, rather then `P : Set α`, to avoid _abusing definitional equality_.

### Some examples:
1. How to prove that something belongs to a set?
1. Positive naturals;
1. Even numbers;
1. An abstract set of `α` given by some `P : Prop`.

+++ Sub(sub-sub-sub)sets are not treated as sets-inside-sets.

Given a (old-style) set $S$, what is a subset $T$ of $S$? At least two answers:
1. Another set such that $x\in T\Rightarrow x \in S$.
1. A collection of elements of $S$.

Now,
1. stresses that $T$ is a honest set satisfying some property;
1. stresses that it is a set whose elements "come from" $S$.

We take the **first approach**: being a subset is *an implication*
```lean
    variable {T S : Set α} 
    def (T ⊆ S : Prop) := ∀ a, a ∈ T → a ∈ S
```

Yet this does not answer the question "How can I *construct* a subset of a set"? The key is _upgrading_ sets 
to types: `T : Set S` for `S : Set α` means `T : Set ↑S = Set (S : Type*)`.

### Some examples:
1. Double inclusions;
1. Subsets as sets;
1. This coercion from `Set α` to `Type*`.

## Operations on Sets
+++ **Intersection & Union**
#### **Intersection**
Given sets `S T : Set α`  have the
```lean
def (S ∩ T : Set α) := fun a ↦ a ∈ S ∧ a ∈ T
```
* Often need **extensionality**: equality of sets can be tested on elements;
* related to _functional extensionality_ : two functions are equal if and only they have if they take the same values on same arguments;
* not strange: sets *are* functions.

#### **Union**
Given sets `S T : Set α` we have the
```lean
def (S ∪ T : Set α) := fun a ↦ a ∈ S ∨ a ∈ T
```

And if `S : Set α` but `T : Set β`? **ERROR!**

`⌘`
+++

+++ **Universal & Empty set, complement and difference**

#### Universal & Empty
* The first (containing all terms of `α`) is the constant function `True : Prop`
```lean
def (univ : Set α) := fun a ↦ True
```
* The second is the constant function `False : Prop`
```lean
def (∅ : Set α) := fun a ↦ False
```
**Bonus**: There are infinitely many empty sets!

####  **Complement and Difference**
* The complement is defined by the negation of the defining property, denoted `Sᶜ`.
```lean
Sᶜ = {a : α | ¬a ∈ S}
```
The superscript `ᶜ` can be typed as `\^c`.

* The difference `S \ T : Set α`, corresponds to the property
```lean
def (S \ T : Set α) = fun a ↦ a ∈ S ∧ a ∉ T
```

`⌘`
+++

+++ **Indexed Intersections & Indexed Unions**
* One can allow for fancier indexing sets (that will actually be **types**, *ça va sans dire*): given an index type `I` and a collection `A : I → Set α`, the union `(⋃ i, A i) : Set α` consists of the union of all the sets `A i` for `i : I`.
* Similarly, `(⋂ i, A i) : Set α` is the intersection of all the sets `A i` for `i : I`.
* These symbols can be typed as `\U = ⋃` and `\I = ⋂`.

# Functions

## Introduction

#### Functions among sets are different gadgets than functions among types.

Let's inspect the following code:
```lean
example (α β : Type) (S : Set α) (T : Set β) (f g : S → T) :
    f = g ↔ ∀ a : α, a ∈ S → f a = g a :=
```
It *seems* to say that `f = g` if and only if they coincide on every element of the domain, yet... `⌘`

+++ Take-home message
To apply `f : α → β` to some `s ∈ S : Set α`, *restrict* it to the *subtype* `↑S` attached to `S`.

## Some operations on sets and functions

+++ (Pre-)image, range, etc...

Given a function `f : α → β` and sets `(S : Set α), (T : Set β)`, we have:

* The **image** of `S` through `f`, noted `f '' S`.
This is the *set* `f '' S : Set β` whose defining property is
```lean
f '' S := fun b ↦ ∃ x, x ∈ S ∧ f x = b
```
Unfortunately it comes with a lot of accents (but we're in France...): and with a space between `f` and `''`: it is not `f'' S`, it is `f '' S`.

* The **range** of `f`, equivalent to `f '' univ`.
I write *equivalent* because the defining property is
```lean
range f := (fun b ↦ ∃ x, f x = b) : β → Prop = (Set β)
```
This is not the verbatim definition of `f '' univ` : there is an exercise about this.

* The **preimage** of `T` through `f`, denoted `f ⁻¹' T`.
This is the set
```lean
f ⁻¹' T : Set α := fun a ↦ f a ∈ T
```
This also comes with one accent and _two_ spaces; the symbol `⁻¹` can be typed as `\^-1`.

+++ Injective and Surjective functions
The function `f` is **injective on `S`**, denoted by `InjOn f S` if it is injective (a notion defined for functions **between two types**) when restricted to `S`:
```lean
def : InjOn f S := ∀ x₁ ∈ S, ∀ x₂ ∈ S, f x₁ = f x₂ → x₁ = x₂
```

In particular, the following equivalence is not a tautology:
```lean
example : Injective f ↔ InjOn f univ
```
rather, it is an exercise for you.

The obvious definition of *surjectivity* is also available...
