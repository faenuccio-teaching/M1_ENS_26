As an example, for bundled\nhoms `f`, `g`, and `of`, `f.comp of = g.comp of → f = g` is a better `ext` lemma than\n`(∀ x, f (of x) = g (of x)) → f = g`, as the former allows a second type-specific extensionality\nlemmas to be applied to `f.comp of = g.comp of`.\nIf the domain of `of` is `ℕ` or `ℤ` and `of` is a `RingHom`, such a lemma could then make the goal\n`f (of 1) = g (of 1)`.\n\nFor bundled morphisms, there is a `ext` lemma that always applies of the form\n`(∀ x, ⇑f x = ⇑g x) → f = g`. When adding type-specific `ext` lemmas like the one above, we want\nthese to be tried first. This happens automatically since the type-specific lemmas are inevitably\ndefined later.\n","docLink":"./Mathlib/Tactic/Ext.html#LibraryNote.«partially-applied ext lemmas»","kind":"def","line":18,"name":"LibraryNote.«partially-applied ext lemmas»","sourceLink":"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/32d24245c7a12ded17325299fd41d412022cd3fe/Mathlib/Tactic/Ext.lean#L18-L31"}}],"imports":["Init","Mathlib.Tactic.Basic"],"instances":[],"name":"Mathlib.Tactic.Ext"}
